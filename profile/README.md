Tools For FLL
=============

This is an assortment of tools and resources to improve the FLL experience.
FIRST&reg; LEGO&reg; League (FLL) is a global robotics competition that
introduces science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to children ages
4-16[^1] through fun, exciting hands-on learning. Participants gain real-world
problem solving experience through a guided, global robotics program, helping
today's students and teachers build a better future together.

These tools are generally divided into two categories:

* Tools for teams: These are tools that are mainly helpful to individual teams
  (either the students, the coaches, or both). In this category are:

  - [FLL Scoring App](https://github.com/tools-for-fll/FLLScoringApp) - a
    progressive web app (PWA) that can be easily installed on a mobile device
    for scoring matches, saving the results, and tracking robot game progress
    over time.

  - [VirtualSpike](https://github.com/tools-for-fll/VirtualSpike) - a web app
    that allows a virtual exploration of the field, placing your own robot onto
    the field, and writing code (in PyBricks' version of Python) to make the
    robot move around the field. At this point, this is functional but still a
    work in progress (notably, there is no documentation!).

* Tools for events: These are tools that are mainly helpful to event organizers
  (either official events or scrimmages). In this category is:

  - [FLL Scorer](https://github.com/tools-for-fll/FLLScorer) - a Java
    application for performing robot game scoring at an event, including a
    match timer and audience display of the live robot game results.
